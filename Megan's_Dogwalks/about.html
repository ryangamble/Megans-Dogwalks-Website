				<h1>About Megan's Dogwalks</h1>
				<img id="about-img" src="images/about.jpeg" alt="Megan's Dogwalks" height="180" width="320" />
				<p>Hi everybody, my name is Megan and I am the proud owner of Megan's Dogwalks! I have always loved animals and especially dogs so one day
					I decided to start walking other people's dogs. I have my own dogs and lots of experience with walking dogs and taking care of animals so
					it was very easy to work with other people's dogs. Eventually some of the dog owners noticed how well I worked with their dogs and asked
					me to help them with basic dog training. I did this for a while and enjoyed it so much that I decided to launch a whole business centered
					around walking and training dogs among other dog services.</p>
				<p>The first service we added to our business was dog products so that owners can conveniently buy food, treats, supplies, toys, and all sorts
					of things without having to make a trip to the store. Then we thought, why not make it even easier by offering a monthly subscription box
					where we send you everything you need to take care of your dog, without having to worry about ordering over and over again. Since launching
					these services our customers have been absolutely pleased with the time and worry they saved by ordering from us.</p>
				<p>Most recently, we have launched two dog boarding locations in Lafayette and Lebanon so that owners who need to get away for a while have a
					place to leave their dog. We offer short and long term visits to fit your needs and we are willing to make accommodations for special needs.</p>
